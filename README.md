## Description

This project aims to provide various helpful tools to enhance the gaming experience for players.  

Currently, the project offers the following tools:  
- **Gear Compare**: This tool can helps players calculate which is the optimal gear for their characters. No more confusion to choose which gear gives higher boost to your stats between two gears!
